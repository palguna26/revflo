## 4. Using AI Code Reviews

### Automatic Analysis
RevFlo's engine works on-demand to save costs and ensure accuracy.

### The Validation Flow (Critical)
To validate a PR, you **must start from the Issue**:
1.  Navigate to the **Issue Page**.
2.  Ensure a **Checklist** exists (Generated by Quantum Engine).
3.  Click **"Run Review"** on the Issue Page.

### The PR Detail View
Once validated, the PR Detail View separates insights into:
-   **Health Score**: The calculated quality score for this PR.
-   **Checklist Coverage**: Which requirements passed/failed.
-   **Code Health**: Security & Style issues found by CodeAnt.
-   **Suggested Tests**: Ready-to-copy `pytest` code generated by Qodo.

### Generating Tests
If Qodo detects missing coverage:
1.  Scroll to the **Suggested Tests** section.
2.  Copy the code block provided.
3.  Add it to your test suite to prevent regressions.

## 5. Issue Management

### Smart Checklists
When you open an Issue, click **"Generate Checklist"** to have **QuantumEngine**:
1.  Analyze the Description.
