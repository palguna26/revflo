# RevFlo Configuration File
# Customize audit rules and thresholds for your repository

version: "1.0"

# Rule Configuration
# Each rule can be enabled/disabled and have custom thresholds and severity
rules:
  # Hotspot: High complexity + High churn
  hotspot:
    enabled: true
    thresholds:
      complexity: 25  # Cyclomatic complexity threshold
      churn: 10       # Number of commits in last 90 days
    severity: critical  # critical, high, medium, low
  
  # Deep Nesting: Excessive indentation depth
  deep_nesting:
    enabled: true
    thresholds:
      indent_depth: 6  # Maximum indentation levels
    severity: high
  
  # Large File: Files that are too long
  large_file:
    enabled: true
    thresholds:
      loc: 300  # Lines of code threshold
    severity: medium
  
  # Complex Module: High complexity without churn consideration
  complex_module:
    enabled: true
    thresholds:
      complexity: 35  # Cyclomatic complexity threshold
    severity: high
  
  # No Tests: Files without test coverage
  no_tests:
    enabled: true
    thresholds:
      min_loc: 100  # Only flag files above this size
    severity: medium

# Global Settings
settings:
  # PR Comment Integration (V2 Feature)
  pr_comments:
    enabled: true
    severity_filter: critical_high  # all, critical_high, critical

# Examples of customization:
# 
# 1. Make hotspot detection more sensitive:
#    hotspot:
#      thresholds:
#        complexity: 15  # Lower threshold = more findings
#        churn: 5
#
# 2. Disable a rule:
#    no_tests:
#      enabled: false
#
# 3. Change severity levels:
#    large_file:
#      severity: low  # Downgrade from medium
#
# 4. Stricter quality standards:
#    large_file:
#      thresholds:
#        loc: 200  # Smaller files required
